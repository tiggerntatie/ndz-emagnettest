  This handy little law is the foundation upon which most of the air core
  coil formulas in this site are based.

    The current element d<b>l</b> on a current filament with current i
    contributes a magnetic field, d<b>B</b>, in a direction normal to 
    the plane formed by d<b>l</b> and the vector <b>r</b>.
    <p/>
    The good news is that by solving this integral for an arbitrary 
    configuration of current filaments (like a coil, or set of coils) you 
    can compute the magnetic field vector at any point in space.
    <p/>
    The bad news is that there is no closed solution to this integral for 
    most interesting configurations of current filaments and vectors 
    <b>r</b>.
    <p/>
    Oh well.
