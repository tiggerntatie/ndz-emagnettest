  Wherever you go.  Whatever you do.  Make sure you don't try to build
  something that doesn't agree with these little gems.

    Gauss's Law for Electricity. The surface integral of electric field 
    over any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. The k 
    factor is the dielectric constant, equal to 1 in free space.

    Gauss's Law for Magnetism. The integral of magnetic flux density over 
    any closed surface is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the 
    fact that no magnetic monopoles have ever been discovered.

    Ampere's Law (as extended by Maxwell). The line integral of magnetic 
    flux density over any closed path is proportional to the rate of change 
    of electric field and electric current in the enclosed region. The &kappa;
    <sub>m</sub> factor is the relative permeability, equal to 1 in free space.

  All of the preceding equations work with units of meters, seconds, teslas 
  (units of induced magnetic flux density, commonly referred to as "magnetic 
  field" or "field"), webers (units of induced magnetic flux), amperes, 
  volts and coulombs. The constants have the following values:
